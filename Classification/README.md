# Classification

Classification models are used when we want to predict the class to which data belongs to.

The following classification templates have been added:
1. Logistic Regression
2. SVM
3. k-Nearest Neighbours
4. Kernel SVM
5. Decision Tree Classification
6. Random Forest Classification

The first two are suitable for linear data. The rest are best used for non-linear datasets. Decision tree and Random forest are best for multidimensional
non-linear datasets. 

Each folder has a test dataset on which the template has been implemented.

For finding out the best model of your dataset, accuracy is not always the best parameter to look for. Its better to look and analyze the CAP graph for better model selection
and avoid the accuracy paradox at the same time.
