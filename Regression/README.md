# Regression

Regression models are used when we want to predict data of continuous values.

The following regression templates have been added:
1. Simple Linear Regression
2. Multiple Linear Regression
3. Polynomial Linear Regression
4. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
5. Decision Tree Regression
6. Random Forest Regression

The first two are suitable for linear data. The rest are best used for non-linear datasets. Decision tree and Random forest are best for multidimensional
non-linear datasets. 

Each folder has a test dataset on which the template has been implemented.

For finding out the best model of your dataset, enter summary(<fit_model_variable>) in the console and compare the R_square value and the Adjusted R_square value of the same. 
R-square value closer to one is generally selected. However, statistical significance and other factors must also be taken into consideration for getting the optimum R-square value.
